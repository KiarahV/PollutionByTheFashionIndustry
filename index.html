    <p> Investigating this social problem I found the many ways fast fashion is harmful to the earth.From the mass produce of clothing to the chemicals used to produce said products.Up next we will talk in depth about the complex aftermaths of mass production,its emotional effect on us and the diffrent solutions to this problem.I will define certain points that contribute with today's topic like fast fashion,organic fibers and dipomina. </p>
         <p>  The concept of fast fashion is to follow and create trends by making cheap versions of such.Commonly known brands like H&M and Zara are perfect examples of the fast fashion industry.Taking note that the fashion industry produces well over 56,000 tons of clothes a year.Zara it self launches over 65,000 new products a year.Equivalent to 2,000 models a day.Meaning his store has a new collection every single month.While other stores add new products every three to four months. </p>

   <div class="information2">
     <p>  The way these huge amounts of clothing are made is infrahuman.Videoclips found showing large groups of people working in small spaces,being payed less than half the minimum wage per hour.Working twelve hours every day.These people are the ones paying the price of our irresponsable purchasing addiction.Going more in depth about this sort of addiction there is a scientific reason why shopping and having new items appeal us so much.That being Dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter produced by the hypothalamus, a small region of the brain that helps you feel pleasure. It's an important part in your reward system, meaning the brain releases dopamine when you do things that feel good or pleasurable or when you complete a task.In this case that feeling you get when you have a new item of clothes or even the cheap price of this piece cause your brain to register this activity as a positive one.Here is when we notice the highly influencial power social media has on us,specificly on the fashion industry.Knowing that now a days influencers receive what are called pr packages to review on line.Being offered sponsorships and money. Using them for advertising and reach their target audience.We as people see influenzers as idols or people you want to be or look like.</p>
     <p> Many brands are starting to paint their products as A hundred percent polyster or 100 recicled.The problem in these is that there is no garantee that what they imply is true.It could be that the product uses organic cotton,but this particular cotton has been harvested using pestisides that are also harmful to the plants.Basically the main target of  '100 percent reciclable clothes,is for the process of producing and disposing of it is non harmful to the earth.There are a few alternatives we as people can put in action to help solve this problem.An example is to donate the clothes we dont use often.The problem to this poor and quick solution is what leads us to this question,where exaclty do these clothes actually end up?To our suprise only a percentage of donated clothes are actually sold in second hand stores.While the rest are either sold to burn or thrown away in landfilds.</p>
   <p> In the end we must understand it is very hard to truly recycle textiles as they are.So what other solutions can be offered to help us lower the percentage of pollution caused by our clothes.Thanks to youtuber Zoe Hong,a mayored fashion designer,I came to understand the actual alternatives that can be applied to the creating and recycling of textiles.She also showed different organizations that have applied these methods that help the enviroment.Zoe talks about the usage of organic fibers for the production on the fabric itself.Organic fibers includes cotton, wool, hemp, flax (linen), and other. natural fibers grown according to national organic standards without the use of toxic and. persistent pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetic engineering.Another great alternative is the usage of preconsumer scraps.Tonele.com is a group that takes the scraps of clothing cuts to make unweaven textile.The amazing method of no waste pattern making is also a must.No waste pattern making is basically arranging your patterns on your fabric in a certain way where there is no space in between.Another underrated method is of course upcycling the pieces of clothing we already own.Wether we make the piece shorter,or tigher.Perhaps convine it with another piece of clothing.It is the action of giving this piece a new life and another chance to be worn.</p>
     <p> At last the one we should all begin with.Decision making.The responsible way of purchasing new clothing items.We should start to think about how the pieces are made,who are they made by,and do I really need this?This are common questions we tend to ignore in the rush of the moment.Making us part of the problem.Which also makes us part of the solution.We have the power to apply pressure to these big corporations so they can make changes.So they can apply the many mentioned solutions to lower the pollution percentages by the textile industry.</p>
